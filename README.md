# Use the MATLAB version that supports Python 3.7, such as MATLAB2020a, to run this demo.
# Run with Python 3.7 and TensorFlow 1.14.
# 
#-----------------------------------------------
# You can replace the dataset used in this demo by yourself. Preprocessing can be done in MATLAB_Function/Preprocessing_CSS.m and ReclassificateKernal.m.
# Users can replace the dataset as needed in "Change Dataset", that is, change the loaded dataset, sample set, and initial classification map.
# Replace the data names corresponding to image (dataset), GT (sample set), and FullClassMap (initial classification map).
#
#-----------------------------------------------
# Three-step process to use this algorithm:
# (1) Open Preprocessing.m in MATLAB
# (2) Run ACGT-Net.py
# (3) Open draw_ClassificationMap.m in MATLAB to produce the output classification map
